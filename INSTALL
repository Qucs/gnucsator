This package has no (standard) build system yet.

The static Makefile has a catchall target to build, a "check" and an "install"
target with the usual semantics. gnucap related options are pulled in from the
executable "gnucap-conf${SUFFIX}" shipped with gnucap (not upstream yet.)

you may want to override some settings, use the makefile snipped "Make2".
SUFFIX=-uf                # program-suffix of your gnucap installation
CPPFLAGS=-DTRACE_UNTESTED # whatever flags go here
QUCS_PREFIX= ...          # this might be not relevant yet.
