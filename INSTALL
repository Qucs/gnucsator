This package has a standard "./configure; make" build system

It has a catchall target to build, a "check" and an "install"
target with the usual semantics. gnucap related options are pulled in from the
executable "gnucap-conf" shipped with gnucap.

More options will be added as needed, and as the Gnucap build system
progresses. For now you may want to override some settings, edit the makefile
snippet "Make2", created by configure.

CPPFLAGS=-DTRACE_UNTESTED # whatever flags go here
QUCS_PREFIX= ...          # this might be not relevant yet.
