This package provides a gnucap based qucsator implementation.

(Currently) it is meant to work like this:
- install qucs (the gui).
- install gnucap (>=20171003)
  - official gnucap from savannah or
  - apt-get install gnucap
- install this package, "make install"
- type
  $ QUCSATOR=gnucsator.sh qucs

In some situations, gnucap paths (as obtained from gnucap-conf) are not
writable.  then, PREFIX can be set to override them, e.g.
$ make clean install PREFIX=/usr/local
("clean" ensures that the custom paths are propagated everywhere).

please see STATUS for the currently available functionality and
tests/*.{net,sch} for example circuits.
