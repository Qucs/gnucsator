== gnucap-qucs

This package provides a gnucap based simulation kernel for qucs, a component
library and related tools.

== gnucsator.sh

replaces qucsator and enhances qucs (the default simulator in qucs) in some
situations. e.g. by introducing stable/fast dc/tran analysis and
extensibility.

Please see STATUS for the currently available functionality and
{tests,examples}/*.{net,sch} for example circuits.

== net2verilog.sh

convert qucsator "net" files into verilog. embedded commands are stripped.

== gnucsator

binary executable. equivalent to gnucap, but loads a different run time
configuration file (gnucsator.rc).

== setup

- install qucs (the gui).
- install gnucap (>=20171003)
  - official gnucap from savannah [1], or
  - apt-get install gnucap (in debian>=buster)
- install this package, "./configure; make install"
- type
  $ QUCSATOR=gnucsator.sh qucs

== customisation

gnucap-qucs ships the main executable from gnucap-custom as gnucsator, it is
much like the usual gnucap, but loads gnucsator.rc at startup. you may
override this, by setting GNUCAP_SYSTEMSTARTFILE. For example

$ QUCSATOR=gnucsator.sh GNUCAP_SYSTEMSTARTFILE=my_own.rc qucs

will run a qucs session with your own gnucsator rc. make sure this file exists
next to gnucsator.rc (or also set GNUCAP_SYSTEMSTARTPATH..).
