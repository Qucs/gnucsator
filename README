== contents

This package provides a gnucap based simulation kernel for qucs, a component
library and related tools.

== gnucsator.sh

replaces qucsator and enhances qucs (the default simulator in qucs) in some
situations. e.g. by introducing stable/fast dc/tran analysis and
extensibility.

Please see STATUS for the currently available functionality and
{tests,examples}/*.{net,sch} for example circuits.

== net2verilog.sh

convert qucsator "net" files into verilog. embedded commands are stripped.

== gnucsator

binary executable. equivalent to gnucap, but loads a different run time
configuration file (gnucsator.rc).
