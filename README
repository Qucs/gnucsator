This package provides a gnucap based qucsator implementation.

(Currently) it is meant to work like this:
- install qucs
- install gnucap
  - upstream gnucap from savannah git [1]
  - or gnucap-uf (>=0.0.2-rc3)
- install this package
- type
  $ QUCSATOR=gnucsator.sh qucs

please see STATUS for the currently available functionality and tests/*.sch for
example schematics.

[1] tested with the autotools branch, vanilla (master) might require some
    manual tweaking
