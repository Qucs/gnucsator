== Qucsator i/o compatibility

The i/o related functionality in gnucsator will be gradually moved into output
plugins. With this, additional glue code, as well as duplicated ("hacked")
plugins will be removed. Future "modular" Qucs supports alternative simulator
kernels. Gnucap can be used through a simulator driver, without gnucsator
executable. Gnucsator still serves as an example, and facilitates testing.

== Component library

The main purpose of this package is to support projects built for and with
Qucsator, the default simulator in Qucs. Future Qucs might ship such models for
devices available in Qucsator that also work with other simulators. Some of the
models could be implemented in a platform independent language (such as
verilog-A).
