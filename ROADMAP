== Component library

The main purpose of this package is to provide components compatible with
Qucsator, the default simulator of the Qucs project. With these, the Qucs
schematics hardwired for use with Qucsator retain their use in Gnucap.

== Qucsator i/o compatibility

Gnucsator provides plugins that allow Gnucap to read and process Qucsator
input. This is meant to facilitate the transition and enables testing of
common features and compare the performances between *csators.

== Schematic format

Once Qucs has moved on to a suitable schematic format there will be no more
need for Qucsator style intermediate netlists with partial data. The idea here
is to pass circuit models from one tool to another wihout losing information,
following an established standard.  See Qucs/ROADMAP for details.

== User supplied component models

As the support for standards in Free Software is growing, it will become more
practical for users to add their own models to the system. Some simulators
implement compact modelling features from Verilog-A, others implement
Verilog-95. Gnucsator inherits language compliance from Gnucap, which is
currently moving towards Verilog-AMS.
