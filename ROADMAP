== Qucsator i/o compatibility

The i/o related functionality in gnucsator will be gradually moved into output
plugins. With this, additional glue code, as well as duplicated ("hacked")
plugins will be removed. Future Qucs might support alternative simulator
kernels. Then, Gnucap could be linked into a simulator driver for Qucs
directly, without gnucsator executable. Then, gnucsator can still serve as an
example, and facilitate testing.

== Component library

The main purpose of this package is to support projects built for and with
qucsator, the default simulator in Qucs. Future Qucs might ship such models
for devices available in qucsator that also work with other simulators.
This component library will be freed from binaries, and may be regarded as
platform independent simulator input. Some of the models could be implemented
in a neutral language (such as verilog-A).
