== Tests for Qucsator

Most tests here are end-to-end tests. They are ran with Gnucap or Gnucsator,
and the output is compared against a recorded reference file. Output means
standard output.

== Running tests

Either here or on top level run

$ make check

The return value indicates success, 0 == "good".

== More details

Tests are listed in MakeList. The extension .net is used for Qucsator input
file, .gc files are Gnucap input. More extensions are

.net.gc.out: Gnucsator output for .net
.net.v.out:  net2verilog.sh output
.gc.out:     Gnucap output for .gc

There are rules for these files in Makefile.in. Run

$ make bjt_pulse0.net.gc.out

To produce the output, or

$ make bjt_pulse0.net.gc.diff

to compare against the recorded reference.

Reference test output is in ref/*.out

== Test protocol

This is inherited from Gnucap. Short story: In source code, the "{" character
is a test hook. It is followed by untested(); unless there is a test that
reaches the hook during "make check". There are syntactical exceptions, where
test hooks don't make sense. The other exception is "itested();", these
indicate that the hook has once been reached during interactive testing.
